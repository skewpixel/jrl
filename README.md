rougelike implemented in Java following [Trystan's roguelike tutorial](http://trystans.blogspot.com/2016/01/roguelike-tutorial-00-table-of-contents.html)

From Trystan's blog:
>For those who want to try making your own roguelike in java, here's the links to each of the 20 posts in my little tutorial I did a few years ago. I try to take it one small step at a time, explain why I'm doing what I'm doing, teach a bit of programming, and move forward with each post.

jrl will mostly follow the tutorial as is, with minor deviation where applicable. For instance, I will not be implementing the applet classes as they are no longer relevant. The project setup will be a little different also as I will be developing a maven based project using IntelliJ IDEA and not Eclipse.

This project makes use of Trystan's [AsciiPanel](https://github.com/trystan/AsciiPanel) for display.
